# Exercise 3.7 Only these numbers

Write a program that asks the user for strings and adds them to a list. The program stops reading when the user enters -1.

Expand the program to ask for a start and end indices once it has finished asking for numbers. After this the program shall prints all the numbers in the list that fall in the specified range (between the indices given by the user, inclusive). You may assume that the user gives indices that match some numbers in the list.
